A bunch of ML and DL algorithm implementations with tests. I kept most of them simple so they can be quickly reimplemented from scratch.
I started this repo after failing a CodeSignal assignment ‚Äî I was so shocked they asked me to implement things like dot product in plain Python that I totally froze

#### Features
- ml algorithms implemented in python and numpy
- dl algorithms implementation in numpy, torch, jax(maybe)
- test suits for every algorithm (WIP)
- notebooks to train implementations and additional tests to better understand algorithms (coming soon)
