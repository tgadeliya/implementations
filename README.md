Implementation of ML and DL algorithms with tests. Most of implementations aimed to be simple to be able to reimplement in reasonably short timr
Idea of creating this repo comes after coding assignment on codesignal when I was shocked that someone can ask about implementation of ML algo in plain python 

### Features
- ml algorithms implemented in python and numpy
- dl algorithms implementation in numpy,torch,jax(maybe)
- test suits for every algorithm
- notebooks with to train implementation and additional tests to better understanding algorithms
